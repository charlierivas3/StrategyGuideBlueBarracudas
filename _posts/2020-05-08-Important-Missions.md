 As you play through the game of Skyrim you will notice that it has many missions, but there are a few that can drastically help your assassin abilities.

 The first questline you’ll want to follow is The Dark Brotherhood:

1) To start the first quest, find an Inn located in one of the major towns.

2) From there talk to the innkeeper and he will tell you about a boy named Aventus Aretino.

3) Once he tells you that, you will get a side quest that tells you the boy is located in a house in the city of Windhelm.

4) Once you travel there, find his house and go inside.

5) Once inside, go up the stairs and you will find Aventus sitting by some bones.

6) Talk to him and do what he asks of you.

7) This will start the Innocence Lost mission.
8) Following 24+ hours (in-game) after you have completed the mission, you will receive a note with a handprint saying “We know.”

9) From there, sleep in a bed, and when you wake up you will have been abducted by The Dark Brotherhood leader, Astrid.

10) Follow her instructions, and you will have the opportunity to join them.

11) Once you join, you will have access to their base, where there is some armor you can pick up.
 
12) One of the most important pieces of armor you’ll want to pick up is the Shrouded Hand Wraps. These allow your one-handed sneak attacks to do double damage. That coupled with the Assassin’s Blade perk will allow you to do 30x sneak damage with daggers.

Another important quest line requires you to have the Dawnguard Downloadable Content (DLC). DLC is an additional patch file that can be added to the game from the internet. Think of DLC as adding additional clothing in your closet. You will always have it in the closet once it is “installed” and now you have more adventures to choose from. With this DLC, you will be able to join the vampire hunting Dawnguard, or become a vampire yourself. It is recommended to become a vampire if making an assassin build as vampires get +25% sneak.
