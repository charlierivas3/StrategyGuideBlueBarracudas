 In the very beginning of the game you get the option to choose a race to play as. To do this sneak build, choose the Khajit race, one of the beast races within the game because of their feline-like faces, because they start with +10 Sneak, +5 One-Handed (weapon type), and +5 Archery. This character gives an additional boost in these three areas from the beginning. 
Once your character is created, start off by doing the first few missions available to you to increase your level. For each level increased, you get the option to increase your Magicka (the energy used to cast spells), Health (the amount of damage any person or creature can take before dying), or Stamina (a character’s physical energy). For this build you will want to focus primarily on Stamina, but also increase the other two from time to time.
