### Traits and What They Do: 

On top of being able to upgrade these three options, you will be given the opportunity to upgrade many different traits. The three most important to the assassin build are: Sneak, Archery, and One-Handed

#### Sneak: 
The sneak skill allows you to be harder to detect when crouched. Once you’re a high enough level in this skill you can unlock the Assassin's Blade perk. This perk allows you to do 15x damage to enemies while sneaking when you’re equipped with a one-handed weapon.

#### Archery: 
The archery skill allows you to do more damage with your bows. You also can unlock the perk Eagle Eye, which allows you to zoom in when aiming. Add Archery Video 

#### One-Handed: 
The One-Handed skill allows you to do more damage with one-handed weapons. These weapons are: daggers, maces, swords, and war axes. Once you get to a high enough level with this skill, you can unlock the Savage Strike perk. This perk lets your standing power attacks do 25% more damage, with a chance to decapitate your enemies.
